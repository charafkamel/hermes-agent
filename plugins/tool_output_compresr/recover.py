"""Addressable recovery references for compressed tool output.

When Compresr's tool-output API returns compressed text with inline drop
markers (``[5 lines removed]``, ``[54 tokens dropped]``, ...), we rewrite each
marker into an ADDRESSABLE reference the agent can recover with its NATIVE
``read_file``/``grep`` tools — either the whole cached original or a surgical
slice::

    [compresr: 5 lines omitted · .compresr/cache/a3f9 L40-44 · Read(offset=40,limit=5) or Grep to recover]

The mechanism does NOT trust marker counts/units. The primary path anchors the
compressed output's verbatim KEPT lines against the cached original and derives
the dropped line range from every original span skipped between anchors. That
works identically for line markers, token markers, and silent drops, and is
robust to ~6% whitespace drift from the compressor (normalized line matching).

This is what makes the compression *lossless-by-recovery*: every dropped byte
is one ``read_file(offset, limit)`` away.
